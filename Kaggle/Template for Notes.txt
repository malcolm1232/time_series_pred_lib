#### Logic Notes
1. Encoding Holiday and non-holiday 
  - "If it's Transfer event then it's not a work day" , "If it's Bridge event then it's not a work day"
2. CalendarFourier(freq = 'W', order = 4) #adds sin and cosine fourier
3. DeterministicProcess #Adds const  trend  trend_squared
4. "Using LinearRegression to make a generalized line (It's usually called blending.)"
#### Technical Notes:
1. Use of Blending using
  - MultiOutputRegressor
  - LinearRegression(fit_intercept = True, .. 
2. Use of MAE vs RMSLE 
  - Because in RMSLE we are applying log, that means higher the value, the lower the deviation.
  - Therefore, I will take the Linear Regression's result instead because it has lower MAE and MAE is reliable because it's robust to outlier
3. Custom Regressor: 
  - If weird trend, we use decision tree instead.
      - ExtraTreesRegressor
      - RandomForestRegressor
      - BaggingRegressor
      - model = VotingRegressor
  - If normal trend,
      - ridge = Ridge(fit_intercept=True, solver='auto', alpha=0.75, normalize=True, random_state=SEED)
      - svr = SVR(C = 0.2, kernel = 'rbf')    
      - model = VotingRegressor([('ridge', ridge), ('svr', svr)]) # Averaging result
