    "2. In [8]: \"Relative sales\" in the plots above are the sales relative to the average. Since there are very regular patterns in the \"month\", \"day of week\", and \"year\" trends. All we have to do is simply memorize these trends and apply them to our predictions by multiplying them to the expected average sales. We get the expected average sales for an item at a store from the historical numbers in the training set.\n",
    "3. In [10]: When we are asked to predict the sales of Item X at Store Y on, say, a Monday in February - all we have to do is to look up the historical average of the sales of Item X at Store Y and then multiply it by a factor corresponding to Monday and then a factor corresponding to February to account for the seasonal and weekly changes in item sales at the stores. Finally, we multiply by the annual growth factor for the year we are predicting for. And thus, we have a very simple forecast of the item's sales.\n",

    "Now, we write the predictor. It's quite simple! When we are asked to predict the sales of Item X at Store Y on, say, a Monday in February - all we have to do is to look up the historical average of the sales of Item X at Store Y and then multiply it by a factor corresponding to Monday and then a factor corresponding to February to account for the seasonal and weekly changes in item sales at the stores. Finally, we multiply by the annual growth factor for the year we are predicting for. And thus, we have a very simple forecast of the item's sales.\n",

    "This predictor will run quite fast and should parse through the whole test dataset in less than 20 seconds. A significant improvement over the \"dumb\" prediction method both in accuracy and compute efficiency."

    "* Try seeing how well the model does on the training set itself and what the SMAPE metric looks like. Does the noise properties make sense? Is there a trend in the SMAPE? Finding regions of high SMAPE in the training set can be a rough indicator of where accuracy is taking a hit on the test set!\n",

    "While it is enticing to throw a complicated magical algorithm at any and all datasets blindly, it is usually easier and more meaningful to simply think about the data and come up with simpler models. This kernel was written to show how easy-to-understand methods such as finding averages and simple regressions used under the guidance of domain knowledge (i.e., thinking about how stores work) do equally as well, if not much better than overly-complicated algorithms."
