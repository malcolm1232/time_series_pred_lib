Time Series Pred Personal Library

# Overview
1. An important lacking aspect of humans is that we don't know what we dont know.
2. Thus, it is a good habit to spend a little time each day to "know what we dont know"
3. Useful Kaggle notebooks w.r.t Multivariate TS Prediction will be uploaded, defining key features / model for future reference.
  - With respect to time series prediction, the key Objective is to identify key work by fellow Kagglers's amazing work to increase predictability for namely MultiVariate Time Series Prediction.
  - In this amazing era of people who love to share their work to improve one another, we want to capitalize on great minds to positively reinforce knowledge and to learn from one another, 


# Objective
#### Short Term Goal:
1. Allow work to be reproducible across time-series domains
2. We want to Identify Key Theoretical and technical aspect of Time Series Prediction

#### Longer Term Goal: 
1. Provides timestamp of Time Series models. 
2. Development of the mankind's mind
